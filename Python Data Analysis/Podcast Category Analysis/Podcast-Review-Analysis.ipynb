Some questions I have after seeing this centers around the type of person who would listen to these podcasts. For example, business-marketing, and business-entrepreneurship are closely related, so its very possible that generally the these listeners are more just likely to give good reviews. On the other side news-daily-news and news-politics are also very closely related. it's possible that the same users giving lower reviews for tv are also leaving the low reviews for society culture. Further more, I know from personal experience that news and politics can be polarizing and triggering. Perhaps the nature of the content itself is influencing the reviews."

If we look at the three highest rated categories, you can also see that they did not receive as many reviews. \n",
